This repo contains four minor projects that test the javascript knowledge of the owner of this repo, i created an app that checks the data type of a user's input, I created an app that deletes a student object in the UI by just typing a number that corresponds with the index and I also created an app that quizzes a user and collates the score of the use, then lastly I created a mini-game of guesses
